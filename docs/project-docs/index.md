# Linea Microfinance Documentation Hub

Welcome! This hub is the canonical entry point for engineers, operators, and stakeholders working on the Linea Microfinance MVP. It provides deep dives, playbooks, and context that build on the high-level overview in the repository [README](../../README.md).

## How to Use This Hub

1. **Start with the system overview** to understand the moving pieces and how they interact.
2. **Follow the getting started track** to install dependencies and run each stack locally.
3. **Reference the operational guides** when deploying, updating parameters, or responding to incidents.
4. **Share the executive brief** when onboarding new stakeholders or pitching the pilot.

## System Overview

Linea Microfinance combines on-chain contracts, an indexing layer, and a Next.js web application to deliver Grameen-style joint-liability lending on Linea Sepolia/Mainnet. A high-level diagram is available in [`docs/architecture.md`](../architecture.md), which covers:

- Contract responsibilities and key safeguards.
- Data flow between the SavingsPool, GroupVault, and CreditLine contracts.
- How the subgraph and frontend consume emitted events.
- Operational touchpoints for governance and deployments.
