# W13 Update — Freeze & Polish

**Status:** ✅ MVP frozen; bug burn-down underway

## Progress
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` documenting frozen MVP scope and dates.
- Authored `RUNBOOK.md` with clean install/run steps, seed data, and known issues.
- Project board P0/P1 triaged: all MVP items closed; polish tasks labeled and scheduled.
- Teammate reran system from scratch using RUNBOOK (Anika on 2024-04-07) and confirmed parity.

## Evidence
- Board screenshot captured in PR notes (Done column filled for MVP stories).
- RUNBOOK excerpt + confirmation note added to update and README cross-link.

## Risks / Dependencies
- Final styling polish for dashboard charts scheduled for Week 14 dry run.

## Next Plan
- Prepare demo script, poster draft, and capture 3-minute clip for dry run.
- Incorporate feedback from TA review into Week 14 PR.
