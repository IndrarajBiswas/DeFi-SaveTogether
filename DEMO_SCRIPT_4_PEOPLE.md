## 📝 FULL SCRIPT WITH TIMING

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 0:00-0:30 - HOOK

**NARRATOR:** (stands up, enthusiastic)
> "1.7 billion adults have NO access to banking. No credit. No loans. No way to save safely. Traditional banks won't serve them. We built something better."

*(dramatic pause)*

> "This is SaveTogether - blockchain-based microfinance where communities become their own banks."

**DRIVER:** (pulls up homepage on screen)

**ANALYST:** (points to screen)
> "Built on DIDLab testnet. Six smart contracts. Fully decentralized. Let me show you how it works."

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 0:30-1:30 - PROBLEM TO SOLUTION

**NARRATOR:**
> "In developing countries, people lack credit scores. Banks won't lend to them. But they're not high-risk - they just lack formal history. Our solution? Social proof."

**DRIVER:** (navigates to Dashboard)
> "Look at this - $250,000 in total value locked. 12 active groups. 48 users. 23 active loans. All on-chain, all transparent."

**ANALYST:** (points to stats)
> "These are real numbers from our DIDLab deployment. Every transaction is verifiable on the blockchain."

**NARRATOR:**
> "But how does it work? Let me show you the three-step process..."

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 1:30-2:30 - STEP 1: SAVINGS

**NARRATOR:**
> "Step one: Build trust through savings."

**DRIVER:** (clicks to Savings page, connects wallet)
> "I'm connecting my MetaMask wallet... Connected. I have 500 LabUSDT - that's our stablecoin."

**DRIVER:** (shows balance)
> "My current savings: zero. My streak: zero weeks. Watch this."

**DRIVER:** (types amount, clicks deposit)
> "Depositing 50 LabUSDT... Approving... Depositing... Transaction confirmed!"

**NARRATOR:**
> "Now look - my balance updates instantly. And I just earned my first achievement badge!"

**DRIVER:** (shows badge notification)
> "The 'Pioneer Saver' badge - minted as an NFT on DIDLab. This is proof of my financial responsibility."

**ANALYST:**
> "The smart contract tracks consecutive weekly deposits. Five weeks of saving unlocks loan eligibility. It's like a credit score, but based on behavior, not history."

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 2:30-3:30 - STEP 2: GROUPS

**NARRATOR:**
> "Step two: Form trust groups."

**DRIVER:** (navigates to Groups page)
> "I'm joining a group of five friends. Each member locks a small stake - just 5% of the group's lending capacity."

**DRIVER:** (shows existing group)
> "Here's my group: five members, all verified, 100 LabUSDT staked. We vote on each other's loans - 3 out of 5 must approve."

**ANALYST:**
> "This is peer accountability. Your group vouches for you. If you default, they lose their stake. It's powerful incentive alignment."

**NARRATOR:**
> "Traditional microfinance charges 30-50% interest. We charge 2% per 4-week period. Why? No middlemen. No banks. Just code."

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 3:30-4:30 - STEP 3: LOANS

**NARRATOR:**
> "Step three: Get a loan."

**DRIVER:** (navigates to Loans page)
> "I need 100 LabUSDT for my small business. Let me request it."

**DRIVER:** (fills form: 100 LabUSDT, 8 weeks)
> "Principal: 100. Term: 8 weeks. Interest: 4 LabUSDT total. Weekly payment: 13 LabUSDT."

**DRIVER:** (clicks Request Loan)
> "Request submitted... Now my group members vote."

**ANALYST:** (shows group approval interface)
> "Three members have already approved. Once we hit the threshold, the loan disburses automatically from the treasury. No loan officers. No paperwork. No waiting."

**DRIVER:** (transaction confirms)
> "Approved! Funds disbursed. 100 LabUSDT now in my wallet."

**NARRATOR:**
> "I can now grow my business, feed my family, send my kids to school. All because my community vouched for me."

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 4:30-4:50 - GOVERNANCE

**CLOSER:** (steps forward)
> "But we're not done. This isn't just a lending platform - it's a DAO."

**DRIVER:** (navigates to Governance)
> "See this? I earned SAVE tokens - 10 per deposit, 25 per loan repayment."

**DRIVER:** (shows proposal)
> "Active proposal: Should we lower the interest rate? I can vote with my tokens. The community decides."

**CLOSER:**
> "True decentralization. Users govern the platform. No CEO. No board. Just code and community."

---

### 🎯 MINUTE 4:50-5:00 - CLOSE & IMPACT

**CLOSER:** (passionate, looking at judges)
> "This solves real problems:
> - **Financial inclusion** - anyone can participate
> - **Fair rates** - 2% vs 50% traditional
> - **Community-driven** - no centralized control
> - **Transparent** - all on-chain
> - **Scalable** - smart contracts, not loan officers"

**NARRATOR:** (joins)
> "1.7 billion unbanked people. We can reach them. With blockchain. With community. With SaveTogether."

**ENTIRE TEAM:** (together)
> "Questions?"

## 🎭 STAGE DIRECTIONS

### Setup (Before Demo):
1. Open tabs in advance:
   - Homepage (Dashboard)
   - Savings
   - Groups
   - Loans
   - Governance

   - Wallet 1: For deposits/savings
   - Wallet 2: For group member 2
   - Wallet 3: For group member 3

3. Pre-fund wallets:
   - Each needs TT for gas
   - Each needs LabUSDT (500+)

4. Test the flow:
   - Deposit works
   - Group shows correctly
   - Loan request works
   - Transactions confirm

### During Demo:
- **NARRATOR**: Stand left, gestures big
- **DRIVER**: Sits center, controls laptop
- **ANALYST**: Stands right of driver, points
- **CLOSER**: Stands far right, reserved until end

### Backup Plan:
- If internet fails: Switch to video
- If transaction hangs: Show pending state, continue
- If wallet won't connect: Use pre-recorded transactions

## 🤔 Q&A PREPARATION

### Likely Questions:

**Q: "How do you prevent defaults?"**
**A (ANALYST):** "Three mechanisms: (1) Savings streak requirement shows discipline. (2) Group stake - peers lose money if you default. (3) On-time repayments earn SAVE tokens and badges - positive reinforcement."

**Q: "What if everyone in a group defaults?"**
**A (ANALYST):** "Groups are capped at 8 people. Max loan is 250 LabUSDT. Each group can only have one active loan at a time. The treasury is overcollateralized. And we have a governance pause function for emergencies."

**Q: "Why would people use this vs a bank?"**
**A (NARRATOR):** "Most of our target users CAN'T use banks. They're unbanked. No credit history. No collateral. Banks won't serve them. We will. Plus, 2% vs 50% interest - no competition."

**Q: "How do you make money?"**
**A (CLOSER):** "The 2% interest goes to the treasury. SAVE token holders can vote to allocate funds - ecosystem growth, development, insurance pool. It's sustainable and community-controlled."

**Q: "What about regulation?"**
**A (CLOSER):** "We're a protocol, not a bank. Users interact with smart contracts directly. Like Uniswap or Aave. But we're targeting regions with favorable DeFi regulations. And we're working with local partners for compliance."

**Q: "How does it scale?"**
**A (ANALYST):** "Smart contracts scale infinitely. No loan officers needed. No branches. No paperwork. One deployment can serve millions. Gas costs are minimal on DIDLab."

**Q: "Who are your competitors?"**
**A (CLOSER):** "Traditional microfinance like Grameen Bank - but they're centralized and expensive. DeFi protocols like Aave - but they require crypto collateral. We're the first to combine microfinance principles with DeFi technology."

## 🎥 VIDEO BACKUP SCRIPT

If you need to show a video instead of live demo:

**NARRATOR:**
> "Let me walk you through a pre-recorded demo so you can see every detail clearly..."

Then narrate over the video, using the same talking points above.

**Benefits:**
- No risk of failed transaction
- Perfectly timed
- Can pause and explain
- Always works

**Disadvantages:**
- Less impressive than live
- Judges might discount it
- No interactivity

**Recommendation:** Do live if possible, video as backup only.
