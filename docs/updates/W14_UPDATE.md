# W14 Update — Dry Run (Poster/Pitch Rehearsal)

**Status:** ✅ Dry run scripted; feedback logged for final polish

## Progress
- Authored `docs/demo/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` with commands, expected outcomes, and fallback path.
- Produced poster draft (`docs/demo/poster.md`) and outline for pitch narrative.
- Recorded 2.5-minute screen capture walkthrough of MVP (placeholder file to be attached in repo releases).
- Captured TA/peer feedback as GitHub issues tagged `polish` for Weeks 15–16.

## Evidence
- Demo runs clean on peer laptop using RUNBOOK steps; metric + security mitigation demonstrated during clip.
- Feedback issue IDs listed in DEMO_SCRIPT references section.

## Risks / Dependencies
- Need to finalize animation timing in slides; otherwise ready for final presentation.

## Next Plan
- Incorporate feedback fixes; focus on accessibility and clarity of call-to-action.
- Prep final submission bundle for Canvas with PR link and evidence screenshots.
